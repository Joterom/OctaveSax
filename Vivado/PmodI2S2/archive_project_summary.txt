---------------------------------
Name      = PmodI2S2
Directory = C:/Users/arthur/Documents/DigilentGit/Multi-Board-Project-Test/proj

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
         This could happen if the project was unarchived in a location where this path is not
