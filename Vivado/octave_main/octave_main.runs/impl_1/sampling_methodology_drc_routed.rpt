2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change and clk_30MHz_clock_change_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change] -to [get_clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change_1 and clk_30MHz_clock_change are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change_1] -to [get_clocks clk_30MHz_clock_change]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change and clk_48MHz_clock_change_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change] -to [get_clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change_1 and clk_48MHz_clock_change are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change_1] -to [get_clocks clk_48MHz_clock_change]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DATA_OUT relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_30MHz_clock_change 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LR_W_SEL relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_48MHz_clock_change 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on MCLK relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_48MHz_clock_change 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SCLK relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_48MHz_clock_change 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on test_out relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_30MHz_clock_change 
Related violations: <none>
