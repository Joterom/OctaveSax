CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT pmod_clk/SCLK_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 26 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    reg/r_reg_reg[22] {FDCE}
    reg/r_reg_reg_c_10 {FDCE}
    reg/r_reg_reg[17] {FDCE}
    reg/r_reg_reg_c_1 {FDCE}
    reg/r_reg_reg[14] {FDCE}
