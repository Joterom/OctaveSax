WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, SAMP/CLK__0/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clk_100MHz 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'SAMP/CLK__0/clk_100MHz' is not directly connected to top level port. 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' is ignored by Vivado but preserved for implementation tool.
